# R Ladies Sydney - Machine Learning workshop part 2

:star: Hello there! :star:

Here I keep all the files for the R-Ladies Sydney workshop, given on the 17th of October, 2018. Files I have uploaded include everything needed to generate the slide deck (`index.rmd`), as well as source code for the Shiny apps demonstrated in the talk.

Libraries you will need to compile these slides include

* `xaringan`
* `ggplot2`
* `randomForest`
* `rpart`
* `class`
* `cvTools`
* `caret`

If you are interested, you might like to see files for *part one* of the ML workshop, which is about **supervised learning techniques**. These are located [here](https://github.com/sarahromanes/r-ladies-ML-1).

Also, massive thanks to **Emi Tanaka** for developing the *Kunoichi* xaringan theme (Yihui Xie), of which the source can be found [**here**](https://github.com/emitanaka/ninja-theme).
